# AlienESPGame

iPhone application that will demonstrate the use of Views, a Tab Bar, and a Picker.
Chooses a random card out of a 52 card deck and challenges the user to guess the card.
When the "Alien ESP" program starts, it (secretly) chooses a random card. 
It then presents you with three views from which to choose: 
In the first view presented, the "Unlock It" view, you unlock the puzzle by using a two component Picker to 'guess' the hidden card. 

You can then select the "Check It" view (available through the Tab Bar) to see if your guess is correct. 
In this view, a message is displayed which indicates whether the guess is correct or not. 
Also displayed is the total number of guesses the player has made. 

The third view is the "Get Hint" view. In fact, it is more than a hint: it simply tells you which card the computer picked.
